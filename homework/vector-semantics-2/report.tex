\section*{Task 3.2. Sparse Vector Representations}

\paragraph{}
We tried X variations of a sparse vector representation. The variations we tried were:

\begin{itemize}
\item ...
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
We used XYZ as the clustering algorithm...

\paragraph{}
We compare the impact of our model and clustering choices by evaluating their performance over the development set ...

\section*{Task 3.3. Dense Vector Representations}

\paragraph{}
We tried X variations of a dense vector representation. The variations we tried were:

\begin{itemize}
\item ...
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
We used XYZ as the clustering algorithm...

\section*{Comparison of Models (from Task 3.2 and 3.3) and error analysis}

\paragraph{}
Overall, our XYZ model, a (sparse/dense) model, performs best.

\paragraph{}
In general, we can compare dense and sparse models by looking at instances where one does well and the other fails.

\paragraph{}
Examples of target words where the dense model scores high and the sparse model scores low are... (describe what they have in common, hypothesize why this might be the case)

\section*{Task 3.4. Clustering Without K}

\paragraph{}
We tried X variations on clustering without K. The variations we tried were:

\begin{itemize}
	\item ...
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
We used XYZ as the clustering algorithm.

\paragraph{}
We designed a model that chose the best K as follows... Our results on the \texttt{test\_nok\_input.txt} data ...
